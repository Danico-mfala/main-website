# Community Guidelines (Code of Conduct)

Like any other open-source organization, this organization is made up of a diverse group of individuals from around the globe who work on every facet of its goals. This diversity is one of its strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.

We take pride in being inclusive and treating everyone with respect,
regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or similar personal characteristics.
We love the diverse opinions of our contributors and maintainers; therefore, we expect you to.

The subsequent subsections go into further detail about our community's guidelines and standards.

## 1. Be more considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful

We want to create a community where everyone feels welcome and receives support from people of different backgrounds and identities.

Thus, we believe we can achieve this by building a positive, welcoming environment where everyone feels safe to share ideas, thoughts, and feedback.
As you contribute, try to be supportive, respect individual opinions, and report inappropriate posts if needed.

Respectful and constructive communication is encouraged and appreciated. We believe that everyone has the right to express their opinions and that constructive criticism is essential to the growth of the project.

However, we also believe that everyone has the right to have their opinions heard, and that any form of harassment or personal attacks is completely unacceptable.

## 2. Expected behavior and choice of words matters

We are a very diverse community. Thus, it would help if you acted professionally.
Therefore, you are to work in a manner thatÂ includes but is not restricted to:

1. Don't use violent threats or language directed against another individual.
2. Consider collaboration before conflict.
3. No discriminatory jokes, insults, and language. This includes discriminatory behavior and speech, especially racist, homophobic, sexist, ageist, or demeaning words/comments.
4. Do not post sexually explicit or violent material.
5. No unwelcome sexual attention.
6. Do not advocate for or encourage any of the above behavior.
7. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
8. Participate authentically and actively to contribute to this community's health and longevity.

Be mindful of your fellow participants and please report any cases of harassment by alerting community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## 3. Disagreements

Disagreements are bound to happen, primarily because of the community's diversity. The strength of the project comes from its diversity. It is, however, important that we resolve disagreements constructively. Another individual having a different perspective or viewpoint on issues doesn't mean they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err, and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

## 4. Zero tolerance for harassment & Unacceptable behavior

Be respectful of everyone's ideas and perspectives on a problem. Don't directly attack a person. We will not tolerate any posts, comments, or messages to fellow contributors, admins, sponsors, or maintainers that are inappropriate, rude, or aggressive. This includes posts that spread misinformation and are disruptive to the communities.

Suppose a community member engages in unacceptable behavior. In that case, the community maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## 5. Reporting guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the organization owner @melvincwng as soon as possible via email at: melvin.ng@outlook.sg.

Each complaint will be investigated. We shall use our discretion to decide when and how to respond to reported incidents, with options ranging from taking no action to banning someone permanently from the project and spaces sponsored by the project.

However, before taking further action, we will inform the accused of the report and give them a chance to speak about it. But we will act without warning in potentially hazardous circumstances, such as persistent harassment or threats to anyone's safety.
